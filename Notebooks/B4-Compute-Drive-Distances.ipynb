To do this we need a network dataset, often called a *graph dataset* of roads, which we get from OpenStreetMap, and a means for analyzing network datasets, which we can do via the `osmnx` package. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis here is guided by the analysis presented in [Lesson 6: Network Analysis in Python](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/notebooks/L6/network-analysis.html) of the Automating GIS curriculum, but with a number of twists. We also need to dig deeper into the graph analysis capabilities of the [NetworkX package](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/index.html), specifically using its [shortest paths](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/algorithms.shortest_paths.html) algorithms to measure network distances away from DFCF chargers.
